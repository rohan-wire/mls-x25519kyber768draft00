1.  Introduction

   This document reserves a Messaging Layer Security (MLS)
   [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] ciphersuite value based on the MLS default
   ciphersuite, but replacing the KEM with the hybrid post-quantum /
   traditional Key Exchange Mechanism X25519Kyber768Draft00
   [I-D.draft-westerbaan-cfrg-hpke-xyber768d00] which was assigned the
   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) Key Exchange Mechanism (KEM)
   Identifier value 0x0030.

2.  Security Considerations

   This ciphersuite uses a hybrid post-quantum/traditional KEM and a
   traditional signature algorithm.  As such, it is designed to provide
   confidentiality against quantum and classical attacks, but provides
   authenticity against classical attacks only.  This is actually very
   useful, because an attacker could store MLS-encrypted traffic that
   uses any classical KEM today.  If years or decades in the future a
   quantum attack on classical KEMs becomes feasible, the traffic sent
   today (some of which could still be sensitive in the future) will
   then be readable.  By contrast, an attack on a signature algorithm in
   MLS would require an active attack which can extract the private key
   during the signature key's lifetime.

   The security properties of
   [I-D.draft-westerbaan-cfrg-hpke-xyber768d00] apply.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new MLS Ciphersuite value.
