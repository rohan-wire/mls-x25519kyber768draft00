# Introduction

This
document reserves a Messaging Layer Security (MLS) {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}}
ciphersuite value based on the MLS default ciphersuite, but replacing the KEM
with the hybrid post-quantum / traditional Key Exchange Mechanism
X25519Kyber768Draft00 {{!I-D.draft-westerbaan-cfrg-hpke-xyber768d00}} which was
assigned the Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) Key Exchange Mechanism (KEM)
Identifier value `0x0030`.

# Security Considerations

This ciphersuite uses a hybrid post-quantum/traditional KEM and a traditional
signature algorithm. As such, it is designed to provide confidentiality against
quantum and classical attacks, but provides authenticity against classical
attacks only. This is actually very useful, because an attacker could store
MLS-encrypted traffic that uses any classical KEM today. If years or decades in
the future a quantum attack on classical KEMs becomes feasible, the traffic sent
today (some of which could still be sensitive in the future) will then be readable.
By contrast, an attack on a signature algorithm in MLS would require an active
attack which can extract the private key during the signature key's lifetime.

The security properties of {{!I-D.draft-westerbaan-cfrg-hpke-xyber768d00}} apply.

# IANA Considerations

This document registers a new MLS Ciphersuite value.
